# Transparency Statement
As a mechanical engineer using C++ for the first time I solved this with nexted for loops resulting in a time complexity of O(N^2). In order to solve this with a time complexity of O(N) I asked ChatGPT what strategies I can use. 

I learned to use hash maps to refrence data I have already visited

### Prompt:
```dont solve it for me but what methods would I use to chnage this solution from O(n^2) to something less time complex```

### Response
```
Great question — here are the methods and ideas you’d use to improve the time complexity:

1. Use a Hash Map (or Hash Set)
Instead of linearly searching the vector (find), store elements in a hash map for O(1) lookups.

Why it helps: Lookup in a hash map is on average O(1) vs. O(n) for linear search.

Use case: Common in problems like "two sum".

2. Preprocessing the Data
Build a data structure (like a map or set) ahead of time that allows faster queries.

Store values as keys in a hash map with their indices or counts.

Reduces repeated work.

3. Two-pointer technique (for sorted arrays)
If the array is sorted or can be sorted, the two-pointer method helps in some subtraction-based problems.

Why it helps: After sorting (O(n log n)), you can solve the problem in O(n) time.

Caveat: Modifies order and changes problem semantics if indices matter.

4. Avoid duplicate work
If you’re checking the same pairs multiple times, track which values you've already processed.

If you want a hint tailored to a specific problem (like "two sum"), let me know — I’ll keep it abstract until then.
